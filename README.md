#### Why Engineer @ Chameleon:

We're a small team who does **a lot with a little** -- we're profitable, we have > 300 customers, a global monthly active user base of > 4 million and multiple times per second someone, somewhere in the world sees a Chameleon experience.
We have a great responsibility to be stable, move fast and provide the best software possible.

We're building out our Engineering team and want you to be a big part of this journey.

#### Why you:

You're you and you love this stuff!

------

#### The Prompt:

Please create and use a component (or components) which displays a list of example user data.
Fetch the data using a network request rather than an import statement -- the data is available at http://localhost:3000/example_data.json
Each item in the list should display any relevant data
The items should be sorted by when they were "created"

Above the list of users we should see a summary of some the data in the table
 - How many team members there are in total
 - When the last user was added to the team
 - How many total users were invited
 - How many total published campaigns

#### The Notes:

 - Assume this is **your project**, any changes you think should be made and libraries you want to use -- the final decision lies with you
 - Ping us if you have any questions
 - Don't spend too long on anything specific -- the goal is to balance time/effort/looks
 - We're are far more concerned with how it works than how it looks in the real world we have mocks/designs/user stories 

-------

#### To begin:

`node -v` should be 12 or greater 
`npm install`
`npm run start`

This runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


#### To submit:

- Send us a link (Drive, Dropbox etc.)
- Create a new GitHub repo and add bnorton and b3nj4m as collaborators (preferred)
